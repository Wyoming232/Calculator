Of course. Reframing the README for a personal portfolio project is a great idea. The focus shifts from collaboration to showcasing your skills, thought process, and what you learned.

Here is a revised README tailored for a personal project meant for your LinkedIn profile.

C-Calc: A Command-Line Scientific Calculator
Project Overview
C-Calc is a personal development project to build a powerful, lightweight scientific calculator that runs from the command line. Written entirely in C, it is designed to parse and evaluate complex mathematical expressions, serving as a practical exercise in applying core computer science concepts.

This project is not intended as open-source software but as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in C programming, data structures, and algorithm design.

Project Goals
The primary objectives for building this project were:

Strengthen C Programming Skills: To write clean, efficient, and robust C code, with a focus on manual memory management.
Implement Core Data Structures: To build and utilize fundamental data structures like stacks and arrays from scratch.
Algorithm Design & Implementation: To design and implement an algorithm for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions with correct operator precedence (e.g., the Shunting-yard algorithm).
Develop a Complete Tool: To create a fully functional command-line application from conception to a usable product.
Features
Complex Expression Evaluation: Accurately computes expressions with multiple operators and nested parentheses, such as ((5 + 3) * (2 - 6)) / 2.
Operator Precedence: Correctly handles the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
Core Arithmetic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
Parentheses Handling: Support for deeply nested parentheses.
Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for invalid syntax or mathematical errors like division by zero.
Tech Stack
Language: C
Compiler: GCC / Clang
Core Concepts: Stack-based evaluation, string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation.
